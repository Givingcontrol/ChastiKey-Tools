# ChastiKey
Here you will find scripts and code used by the ChastiKey mobile app that I've decided to share publicly.

These are shared either because people have shown interest in knowing how certain scripts or parts of the app work, or to hopefully receive feedback/suggestions on how they could be improved.

ChastiKey can be downloaded from the following mobile app stores:

Play Store (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.kevincross.chastikey

App Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chastikey/id1375243924?mt=8
